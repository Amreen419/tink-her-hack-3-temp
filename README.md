The schematic illustrates the architecture of the Doctron App, a mobile application designed to enhance healthcare accessibility and emergency response. The system begins with the Patient‚Äôs Mobile Application, which allows users to book appointments, access online consultations, and send emergency alerts containing their real-time location. The app communicates with the backend using the internet through HTTP requests, enabling seamless data transfer. At the backend, a Database securely stores patient records, appointment schedules, and blood donor information. The Patient Server processes user requests, such as sending location data and emergency alerts, while the Administration Server handles tasks related to healthcare providers, such as managing services and administrative functions. Together, these components provide an efficient, reliable system to deliver healthcare services and improve response times during¬†emergencies.
